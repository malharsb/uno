Team MooPointers


Instructions to compile the alpha version
- Using the pre-build code
1 checkout alpha_version from the server
2 cd ~/alpha_version/build/main/Debug
3 Execute game.exe

- The game should open in the terminal (alpha version is a terminal-based game)
- The goal of the alpha version is to build, test and debug the core game logic
- You will be playing against a number of bots
- These bots are a little more intelligent than you think, so beware :)
- Play your first card and enjoy the game!
